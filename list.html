<H1>2)<mark>UMANANDA TEMPLE</mark></H1>:Umananda Temple is located on Peacock Island that lies on the mighty Brahmaputra River. This serene place of worship is named after and dedicated to Lord Shiva. The name 'Umananda' comes from the two Hindi words, namely 'Uma', which was another name for Lord Shiva’s wife and 'Ananda' which means happiness. In fact, Peacock Island is one of the smallest inhabited island and possibly one of the most beautiful too. The surroundings of the temple and the divine but understated beauty of the island make it a haven for nature lovers.
The temple is situated on the top of a hill called Bhasmakala or Bhasmakuta. The island was originally built in 1694 A.D. by King Gadadhar Singha. However, it was destroyed by an earthquake in 1897 and later rebuilt by a wealthy local merchant. The Umananda temple was crafted beautifully by the skilled Assamese workmen. Aside from Lord Shiva, there are 10 other Hindu Gods whose idols reside in the shrines.
Aside from being a place of worship, The Umananda temple is also a pleasurable exception to the typical places of worship. Devoid of the cacophony of forceful religion, this place has a serene environment which makes you want to sit down for a while and absorb the beauty of the place.

<H1>5) <mark>SILK LOOM IN ASSAM:<mark> </H1> There has been a tremendous change in the socio-economic scenario of the silk loom sector as a whole. The sector that had once attained global recognition and accreditation because of its uniqueness, beauty, artistic work has now lost its identity, charm and has failed to meet the requirement in the global market due to various factors. Efforts from the state as well as the central government along with the owners of the silk loom industries are necessary to save this heritage sector. The increase in wage is considered to be the most important matter as low wage has been identified as the major problem of the weavers to maintain their livelihood. The government can subsidise the sector by providing credit, building necessary social, economic and financial infrastructure, arranging marketing campaigns worldwide. There should be the provision for loans with low interest rate for the explorations workers. Promotion of marketing of indigenous Assam silk products in the local as well as in the global market is necessary to give the sector a boost .Protection of the weavers and the sector should be identified as one of the major agenda. They must get the benefit of various acts of the government for protecting the interest of workers. Sualkuchi has to depend for raw materials from outstation markets which are costly. Therefore, the government should monitor the price by putting a standard level for all the goods and materials so that it will be accessible to the owners and weavers at an affordable budget. There is also an urgent need to put a ban on the selling of cheap materials imported from other places in the name of original silk products, because these low quality machine-made materials have brought defamation to the traditional silk loom sector. This has led to loss of work for many weavers. It is also very important to improve the relationship between the owners and the workers in this sector. Proper health and education facilities should be there for the workers and their children. Establishing cooperative societies for the workers, providing salary on time, training, funding, supply of raw materials, creating more employment opportunities and ensuring regular work in the sector, ensuring better work environment are viewed as important factors for the overall development of the sector and livelihood of the workers.

Constructed in the second half of the 18th century, the temple was built by the Ahom king, Raja Rajeswar.This ashram is the last existing monument, which was constructed by the rulers of the Ahom dynasty. The ashram is the meeting point of three rivulets namely, Sandhya, Kanta and Lalita.According to a popular belief, it is said that a dip in the water enhances a person’s life and also washes off the sins committed. In addition, there are several legends associated with sage Vashistha and this ashram.According to one of the popular legends, it was said that the hermit Vashistha used to perform his ‘sandhya’ in a stream near his ashram, which was also his home. The sage became agitated due to the ardent games played by Lord Indra with his queen Shachi and other heavenly women in the stream, as the water became impure.As a result of this, the sage cursed Indra that he would have sexual contact with a Daitya woman. This curse transformed Indra into a normal person and the curse of Vashistha also came true.However, Lord Indra granted the Daitya woman with a blessing that her son would become a king. Her son later became the progenitor of the Ahom Kingdom and was the ruler of the entire region of Assam. According to another legend, it is believed that the sage gained spiritual success by dwelling into the secrets of Sakta practices.
